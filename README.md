# Traffic Accident Analysis


# Overview

This repository contains an analysis of traffic accident data, focusing on identifying patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The analysis aims to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

# Task Description

The objective of this task was to analyze traffic accident data to uncover insights about accidents over the years and to visualize various factors influencing road safety.

# Key Visualizations

Heatmap of Accidents Across States/UTs By Months:

 Visualized the distribution of accidents across different states and union territories over the months.

# Total Accidents Over the Years (2001-2014):

Created a line plot to show trends in total accidents over the years from 2001 to 2014.

# Night vs. Day Accidents:

Used seaborn bar plots to compare the number of accidents occurring during the night and day.
Total of Night and Day Accidents by State:

Visualized the total number of accidents categorized by night and day for each state.
Comparison of Night and Day Accidents by State:

# Presented a bar plot comparing night and day accidents across different states to highlight patterns in road safety.

# Libraries Used
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
NumPy

# Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into traffic accidents and can assist policymakers and researchers in enhancing road safety measures.
